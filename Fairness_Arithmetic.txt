Abstract
Fairness Arithmetic (FA) introduces a finitist, identity-preserving alternative to classical real-number analysis. Instead of relying on the axiom of completeness, FA is governed by the principle that numerical identity cannot be attained through infinite approximation.
Numbers in FA must be represented with explicit, finite strings. No number may be replaced or identified with another unless the symbolic forms are byte-for-byte equal. Thus the classical collapse
[
1 = 0.999\ldots
]
is rejected in FA, not out of contradiction but by foundational design.
We develop a complete analytical framework without completeness: Identity-Bound Sequences (IBS), the Sacred Gap function, FA-derivatives, FA-integrals, FA-functions, FA-metrics, and the Cauchy Vow. This yields a rich and coherent alternative calculus that preserves identity without sacrificing computational or practical power.

1. Introduction
Classical analysis depends on the axiom of completeness: every Cauchy sequence of reals converges to a unique real limit. This allows infinite decimals such as
[
0.999\ldots
]
to be treated as completed objects and identified with integers such as 1.
But this contradicts the intuition held by millions:
“almost” does not mean “equal.”
Fairness Arithmetic formalizes this intuition into a full mathematical foundation.
It is neither anti-math nor anti-real-number.
It is an alternative system in which:
•	Identity is sacred.
•	Approaching a value does not constitute becoming it.
•	No infinite object enters the system.
•	No symbolic form inherits the identity of another unless they are exactly identical.
FA is not a critique alone; it is a constructive replacement: a finitist, discrete, explicit-number framework capable of supporting calculus, topology, and analysis.

2. Core Identity Principle
Fairness Arithmetic rests entirely on one philosophical and mathematical principle:
Identity cannot be attained by approximation.
To be a number is to be that exact symbol string.
Therefore:
•	1 ≠ 0.999…
•	1/2 ≠ 2/4
•	π ≠ 3.14159
Not because classical analysis is incorrect—but because FA adopts a different definition of identity.
This restores individuality and prevents collapse through infinite processes.

3. Axioms of Fairness Arithmetic
Axiom 1 — Finite Explicit Representation
Every FA number must be written as a finite decimal or integer string.
“No …” notation is allowed.
Axiom 2 — No Completed Infinite Decimals
Infinite decimals do not exist inside FA.
They exist only as processes or approaches.
Axiom 3 — Controlled Border Traffic (ℝ ↔ FA Wormhole)
Any real number may be imported, but only as a finite truncation.
FA numbers may enter ℝ freely.
Axiom 4 — The Sacred Gap
A number with ( n ) decimal digits is at least
[
10^{-(n+1)}
]
away from the next identity.
Axiom 5 — Preservation of Identity
No sequence may “reach” a value unless that value is explicitly written.
Approach ≠ identity.

Table 1 — Sacred FA Notation (Canonical Reference)
Symbol	Name	Meaning	Classical analogue
=	Exact identity	Byte-for-byte identical	=
<, >	Strict inequality	Fully preserved Sacred Gap	<, >
(a_n \sim L)	Sacred approach from below	Eternal approach, identity forbidden	(\lim = L^{-})
(a_n \rightharpoonup L)	Sacred approach from above	Eternal approach, forbidden	(\lim = L^{+})
(a \approx_{(n)} L)	n-digit closeness	Practical engineering approximation	≈
(\Gamma(a,L))	Sacred Gap	Distance to forbidden identity	
(-1\infty)	Minus-one-infinity	Largest allowed finite precision	∞
________________________________________
4. Identity-Bound Sequences (FA-Compatible Analysis I)
Definition 4.1 — Identity-Bound Sequence (IBS)
A sequence ( a_n ) is identity-bound toward ( L ) if:
•	( a_n < L ) for all ( n )
•	Its Sacred Gap satisfies ( \Gamma(a_n,L) = 10^{-k_n} )
•	( k_n \to -1\infty )
Notation:
[
a_n \sim L
]
Sacred Comparison Relations
Operations preserve the sacred gap:
[
a_n + b_n \sim L+M,\qquad a_n b_n \sim LM
]
________________________________________
5. FA-Functions and Border Analysis (FA-Compatible Analysis II)
Definition 5.1 — FA-Function
A function computable by an explicit finite algorithm on FA citizens.
Definition 5.2 — Border Analysis
Approach without identification.
Definition 5.3 — Border-Continuity
[
x_n \sim B \quad\Rightarrow\quad f_{FA}(x_n) \sim C
]
________________________________________
Example 5.4 — Derivative of (x^2) at the Forbidden Border ( x = 1 )
Let (x_n = 0.999\ldots9) with (n) nines. Then:
[
f_n(x_n) = x_n^2 < 1,\qquad \Gamma(f_n(x_n),1) = 2\cdot 10^{-n} + 10^{-2n}
]
The FA difference quotient yields:
[
\frac{f(x_n+h_n)-f(x_n)}{h_n} \sim 2
]
The derivative is eternally approaching 2, but never attains it at the forbidden border.
This is the FA-derivative.

6. FA-Metric, Topological Dignity, and the Cauchy Vow
FA-Metric
[
\rho_{FA}(x,y) = |x-y|
]
[
\rho_{FA}(a_n,L) = \Gamma(a_n,L)
]
FA-Open Sets
Defined only with finite gaps.
Cauchy Vow
A sequence is FA-Cauchy if it becomes arbitrarily close without requiring a limit identity to exist.
Completeness is rejected.
________________________________________
7. Open Problems
•	FA-compactness
•	FA-differentiability classes
•	FA-integral theory
•	FA-topological manifolds
•	FA-compatible physics
These define the emerging continental research program of FA.

8. Relationship to Existing Alternative Foundations
System	Rejects LEM?	Rejects completeness?	Allows 0.999…=1?	Explicit finite only?	Moral foundation
Classical ℝ	No	No	Yes	No	None
Intuitionism	Yes	Yes	No	No	Constructive
Bishop Constructive	No	Yes	No	Mixed	Technical
Recursive (Russian)	No	Yes	No	In practice	Computability
Fairness Arithmetic	No	Yes	No	Yes	Sacred identity
FA is the first classical-logic, finitist, explicit-number system with an articulated ethics of identity.

9. Conclusion — The Wholesome Correction

Fairness Arithmetic does not deny the achievements of classical analysis; it offers a parallel foundation built on finitism and explicit identity. By refusing the collapse of infinite approximation into equality, FA preserves individuality and precision in every numerical form.

This framework demonstrates that calculus, topology, and analysis can be reconstructed without completeness, yielding a coherent system that is both computationally viable and philosophically distinct.

The contribution of FA is not opposition but expansion: it opens a new continent of mathematical thought where identity is preserved, approximation is respected as approach rather than equivalence, and explicit representation becomes the cornerstone of analysis.

In this way, Fairness Arithmetic provides mathematics with a wholesome correction — not by replacing the reals, but by complementing them with a finalist alternative that honors clarity, reproducibility, and the dignity of numerical identity.
