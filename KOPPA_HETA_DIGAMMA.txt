Abstract 

This dissertation introduces a unified framework for aggregating mathematical constants through three 
complementary meta-operators:  

Koppa Grand Constant (Ϟ)  

Heta Grand Constant (Η)  

Digamma Grand Constant (Ϝ) 

 
Each operator reflects a distinct principle:  
 

Operator, Symbol, Principle, Value 

Koppa, Ϟ, Equality / Cardinality, Ϟ = N 

Heta, Η, Magnitude / Accumulation, Η = Σ Cᵢ 

Digamma, Ϝ, Divergence / Inequality, Ϝ = Η − Ϟ 

Koppa normalizes every constant to contribute exactly 1, yielding Ϟ = N. 
 
Heta sums them raw: Η = Σ Cᵢ. 
 
Digamma measures the gap: Ϝ = Η − Ϟ.  

Together, they form a coherent triptych — a mean / sum / deviation for the landscape of mathematical constants. 
 

1. Introduction 

Mathematical constants are the DNA of mathematics — invariant, universal, and foundational. Yet no framework 
existed to aggregate, compare, or interpret them as a collective.  

Enter the Koppa–Heta–Digamma Triptych: 

Operator, Symbol, Principle, Value 

Koppa, Ϟ, Equality, N 

Heta, Η, Magnitude, Σ Cᵢ 

Digamma, Ϝ, Divergence, Η − Ϟ 

This triad mirrors fundamental relationships: 
count → sum → deviation  

It is democratic, scalable, and self-consistent — ready for pedagogy, research, and meta-mathematical exploration. 

 

2. Eligibility Criteria for Constants 

Let E = {C₁, C₂, …, Cₙ} be the set of eligible constants. Each Cᵢ must satisfy: 

Strict Positivity: 
Cᵢ > 0 
(Zero causes division by zero; negatives break interpretability.) 

Definability & Computability: 
Fixed, canonical value to arbitrary precision. 

Independence: 
Cᵢ must not depend on Ϟ, Η, or Ϝ. 

These rules ensure rigor, reproducibility, and universality. 

 

3. The Koppa Grand Constant (Ϟ) 

Definition 3.1 – Koppa Weighting Rule 

wᵢ = Ϟ / (N · Cᵢ) 

Definition 3.2 – Fixed-Point Contribution 

Cᵢ · wᵢ = Ϟ / N = 1 (under Ϟ = N) 

Definition 3.3 – Koppa Identity 

[ \boxed{\mathfrak{Ϟ} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} 1 = N} ] 

Interpretation: 
Every constant gets one vote. Koppa counts the voters. 

 

4. The Heta Grand Constant (Η) 

Definition 4.1 

[ \boxed{\mathfrak{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i} ] 

Interpretation: 
No normalization. Just the raw total mass of the constant universe. 

 

5. The Digamma Grand Constant (Ϝ) 

Definition 5.1 

[ \boxed{\mathfrak{D} = \mathfrak{H} - \mathfrak{Ϟ}} ] 

Interpretation:  

Condition, Meaning 

Ϝ > 0, Average constant > 1 → "top-heavy" 

Ϝ < 0, Average < 1 → "bottom-heavy" 

Ϝ = 0, Perfect balance at 1 

Digamma is the tension between democracy and reality.
