Compliance Paths:
- Two optional compliance paths allow closed or private code use:
  • **OKOKOK Path**: Open-source or AI entities may submit a unique `.exe` file with ID + icon to the `OKOKOK` folder in the Zero-Ology GitHub repository.
  • **YESYESYES Path**: Private companies may comply by either acknowledging Zero-Ology authorship or submitting a unique `.exe` file with ID + icon to the `YESYESYES` folder in the Zero-Ology GitHub repository.
