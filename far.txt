Abstract  

Modern mathematics is the result of eighteen independent but tightly coupled rule choices made between roughly 1880 and 1930. Each choice closed off a family of alternatives that were judged “non-standard”, “pathological”, or simply inconvenient for the emerging programme of Hilbert-style formalisation.  
This dissertation does not attempt to overturn the classical edifice. Instead, treating the choices as variational parameters, it asks the narrower scientific question:  
What mathematics emerges if we simultaneously move all eighteen parameters to their historically rejected values while demanding (i) finite representability and (ii) algorithmic executability?

The answer is a single, fully explicit, finitely implementable arithmetic — called Finite Arithmetic Reflection with Bespoke Equality Frameworks (FA-R + BEF) — that satisfies all eighteen rejected constraints at once without internal contradiction.

Core Construction  

The system FA-R + BEF is defined in fewer than 100 lines of executable Python (see Appendix A). Every object is a pair  

`(finite digit tuple , explicit stage ∈ ℕ)`  

with all operations (addition, inversion, equality, limit queries, etc.) parameterised by explicit user-supplied policies. The resulting arithmetic is:

- strictly finite in memory and time at every step  
- fully constructive  
- equipped with non-collapsing decimals  
- natively non-commutative and partially closed  
- carrying multiple coherent limits  
- supporting synthetic infinitesimals  
- providing translation functors to and from classical ℝ when desired  

No axiom of choice is invoked, no completed infinity is postulated, and no object is ever forcibly identified with another against the chosen equality policy.

Principal Results  

1. All eighteen rejected rule clusters are simultaneously satisfiable in one coherent system.  
2. The resulting variational system is strictly stronger than classical ℝ for physical modelling purposes: it contains classical real numbers as an optional quotient while also containing infinitesimals, explicit non-determinism, and tiered computation.  
3. Every classical theorem that survives the translation remains valid; every theorem that depended on a rejected rule receives a precise diagnostic of which variational parameter caused the failure.  
4. The construction is executable on contemporary hardware with zero runtime errors and bounded resources.

Conclusion  

By treating the foundational debates of the early twentieth century as variational parameters rather than as absolute victories or defeats, we show that the historically “rejected” column can be assembled into a coherent, finitely implementable arithmetic. The resulting FA‑R + BEF framework does not seek to supplant classical analysis; instead, it complements it by offering an alternative lens where identity, finiteness, and explicit choice are preserved.

This inclusive perspective highlights that classical ℝ and FA‑R can coexist as dual systems: one optimized for infinite completeness, the other for finite reproducibility. Together they broaden the landscape of mathematical practice, enabling researchers to choose the framework most appropriate to their computational or philosophical goals.

In this way, FA‑R + BEF contributes not by breaking molds, but by expanding the toolkit of mathematics — offering a constructive, reproducible foundation that sits alongside classical methods and invites further exploration, collaboration, and refinement.
