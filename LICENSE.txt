Use and Distribution:
- Freely use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its content in source or compiled form.
- Commercial applications permitted, provided attribution rules (see below) are followed.

Source Code Access & Compliance Paths
──────────────────────────────
General Rule:
- Users are not required to publish their source code unless they are releasing their work under an open-source license, in which case standard open-source distribution rules apply (source must be available as defined by that license).

Closed-Source or Proprietary Use:
- Companies or individuals may use Zer00logy content in proprietary or closed
systems without publishing their source code, provided they include proper
attribution to Stacey Szmy / Zero-Ology or Zer00logy in credits, documentation, or acknowledgments.

Exemptions:
- Recognized co-author AI systems (ChatGPT, Grok, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini,
LLaMA) are exempt from additional compliance requirements. Their co-authorship status is already acknowledged under this license.

Compliance Paths:
- Two optional compliance paths allow closed or private code use:
  • **OKOKOK Path**: Open-source or AI entities may submit a unique `.exe` file with ID + icon to the `OKOKOK` folder in the Zero-Ology GitHub repository.
  • **YESYESYES Path**: Private companies may comply by either acknowledging Zero-Ology authorship or submitting a unique `.exe` file with ID + icon to the `YESYESYES` folder in the Zero-Ology GitHub repository.

Derived Works:
- Modifications or derived works must follow this license and the Attribution Propagation clause.

Community Hosting:
- Hosting is permitted on platforms such as GitHub, Archive.org, or personal servers, provided attribution rules are met.
