Peer Review Permissions & Contributor Roles
1. Peer Review & Academic Submission Permissions
Restrictions:

You may not use this work for commercial purposes without explicit written permission, unless a credited AI co-author is included.
You may not modify or redistribute this work without explicit written permission, unless a credited AI co-author is included.

You may submit equations, formulas, axioms, or other content from this project (including the Varia Math Series, Zero-Ology, Zer00logy and related works by Stacey Szmy) to academic journals, conferences, or peer-reviewed venues for formalization, verification, or publication, provided the following rules are strictly followed:
1.	Primary Authorship: Stacey Szmy must be listed as the primary or originating author on all submissions, including the title page, author list, and any acknowledgments or footnotes.
2.	Additional Contributors: Individuals providing definitions, verifications, expansions, or editorial refinements may be listed as co-authors or contributors using approved titles (see Section 2). Titles must not imply ownership or origination of the core framework.
3.	Framework Integrity: Submissions must not redefine or alter the fundamental framework in a way that creates new ownership claims. All expansions must cite this repository and the original works (including ISBNs and GitHub timestamps) as the source, preserving the "authorship-trace lock."
4.	Credit and Recognition: All awards, accomplishments, grants, or recognitions arising from submissions shall be represented in the name of Stacey Szmy as the primary beneficiary. Szmy reserves full discretion on whether and how to share credit, proceeds, or honors with additional contributors.
5.	Submission Workflow:
o	Contributors push their draft article/equation to the push_review folder in a personal branch.
o	Contributors submit a pull request requesting maintainers to review and merge the changes into the pull_review folder.
o	Maintainers review the pull request for compliance with this license, originality (no duplicates in pull_review), and proper attribution.
o	Once approved and merged, the submission is officially part of the pull_review folder and may be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
o	All submissions must include a link to this license and the Zero-Ology GitHub repository.
6.	Institutional Exceptions: The following institutions may submit directly to peer review without using the push_review folder, provided all other rules are followed:
Stanford University, MIT, Princeton University, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, Harvard University, Yale University, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, University of Cambridge, UCLA, IAS, University of Edinburgh, University of Helsinki, LMS, IMU, MAA, Boeing, NASA, Meta Platforms, Inc., Alphabet Inc., xAI, Microsoft Corporation, OpenAI.
7.	Enforcement: Violations of these rules constitute a breach of this license. Stacey Szmy reserves the right to pursue remedies under copyright, authorship, or symbolic rights.
8.	Commercial Use: This permission does not extend to commercial uses, which remain prohibited without separate explicit written permission.
9.	Formula Integrity & Symbolic Authorship Lock: All original formulas, axioms, abbreviations, and symbolic structures authored by Stacey Szmy must remain unchanged in any peer-reviewed submission. Contributors may not rename, reformat, derive, or alter any original symbolic content for journal publication. If new axioms or formulas are derived from the original framework, primary authorship of those derivations defaults to Stacey Szmy. Co-authors may be credited for assistance or refinement using approved contributor titles, but may not claim origination or ownership of derived symbolic content. Submissions that violate this clause—by modifying symbolic titles, abbreviations, or foundational structures—will be rejected and may result in revocation of peer review privileges.
